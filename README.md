## Interests

Some of the things I use most include:

* [React](https://github.com/facebook/react)
* [NodeJs](https://github.com/nodejs/node)
* [VS Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode)

I am currently learning:

* [Go](https://github.com/golang/go)
* [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust)

I started this journey a few years ago, wanting to teach myself to HTML and CSS to make a basic photography website, without using the same old sites from wix or wordpress that everyone else was. Once I dove in, I discovered how natural the learning process was to me and the passion I have for creating new things. Fast forward to now and many freelance and personal projects later, I am seeking my first job as a professional developer.
