## Interests

Some of the things I use most include:

- [React](https://github.com/facebook/react)
- [NodeJs](https://github.com/nodejs/node)
- [VS Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode)

I am currently focusing on learning:

- [Go](https://github.com/golang/go)
- [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust)

My current project is:

- [cat_in_x_flavors](https://github.com/lrth06/cat_in_x_flavors)

I started this journey a few years ago, wanting to teach myself to HTML and CSS to make a basic photography website, without using the same old sites from wix or wordpress that everyone else was. Once I dove in, I discovered how natural the learning process was to me and the passion I have for creating new things. Fast forward to now and many freelance and personal projects later, I am seeking my first job as a professional developer.
